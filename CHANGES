Version 1.1
=============
Major:
 * Functions with a varying number of parameters are now supported
 * Removed VariableDoesntExistException (this class was a remainder from the old version and was never thrown by anything)
 * Attempting to call a function with the wrong parameter types now triggers a Lua error instead of an exception
 * Now possible to write and read enums

Minor:
 * Added reading LuaFunctionCaller as a faster alternative to reading functions
 * Fixed writing std::vector producing arrays starting at offset 0
 * Registered functions are now stored inside the Lua state instead of maps in LuaContext
 * Added more assertions and more static assertions
 * Fixed exception safety when writing inside tables
 * Now using Boost type_traits instead of standard library type_traits
 * Writing a function or function object with a trivial destructor now writes a C closure instead of a userdata with metatable
